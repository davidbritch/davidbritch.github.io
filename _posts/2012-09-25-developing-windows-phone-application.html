<p>Last year I worked with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/bb190332.aspx">Patterns and Practices</a> to develop a number of pieces of guidance concerning Windows Phone development. One of the items was <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848247">Developing a Windows Phone Application using the MVVM Pattern</a>.</p> <p>This guidance shows you the basics of MVVM and dependency injection through a sample application, PetrolTracker, that enables you to track the petrol consumption of three vehicles. The sample application is authored two different ways so that you can see the progression from a code-behind implementation, to a view model implementation whose dependencies are injected. Some of the topics that you will learn about include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Application Launching Events  <li>Saving and Restoring Page State  <li>The Motivation for MVVM  <li>The MVVM Pattern  <li>The Benefits of MVVM  <li>Connecting View Models to Views  <li>Dependency Injection  <li>Invoking Commands from a View  <li>Invoking Navigation from a View  <li>Displaying User Interface Notifications  <li>Abstracting the Windows Phone 7.1 SDK  <li>Unit Testing MVVM Applications </li></ul> For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848247">Developing a Windows Phone Application using the MVVM Pattern</a>.
