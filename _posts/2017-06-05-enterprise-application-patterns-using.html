For the last few months I've been working on a Xamarin.Forms guide, about building cross-platform enterprise apps. The first edition of the guide is now published as an eBook, and can be downloaded <a href="https://aka.ms/xamarinpatternsebook">here</a>, or by clicking the image below.<br />

<br /></div>
<h3>
What's it all about?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph">
The eBook provides guidance on building cross-platform
enterprise apps using Xamarin.Forms. It focuses on providing architectural
guidance for developing adaptable, maintainable, and testable Xamarin.Forms
enterprise apps. Guidance is provided on how to implement MVVM, dependency
injection, navigation, validation, and configuration management, while
maintaining loose coupling. In addition, there's also guidance on performing
authentication and authorization with IdentityServer, accessing data from
containerized microservices, and unit testing.<o:p></o:p><br />
<br />
<div class="Paragraph">
The guide comes with source code for the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/tree/master/src/Mobile">eShopOnContainers
mobile app</a>, and source code for the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers">eShopOnContainers
reference app</a>. The eShopOnContainers mobile app is a cross-platform
enterprise app developed using Xamarin.Forms, which connects to a series of
containerized microservices known as the eShopOnContainers reference app.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Who's it intended for?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph">
The guide is aimed at readers who are already familiar with Xamarin.Forms. For a detailed introduction to Xamarin.Forms, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/">Xamarin.Forms documentation</a>&nbsp;on the Xamarin Developer Center, and&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/xamebook">Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms</a>.</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<br /></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
The guide is complementary to&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/microservicesebook">.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications</a>, which focuses on developing and deploying containerized microservices.</div>
<br /></div>
</div>
<h3>
What's in the sample application?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph">
The guide includes a sample application, eShopOnContainers,
that's an online store that includes the following functionality:</div>
<div class="List-Bulleted2" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">
</div>
<ul>
<li>Authenticating
and authorizing against a backend service.</li>
<li>Browsing
a catalog of shirts, coffee mugs, and other marketing items.</li>
<li>Filtering
the catalog.</li>
<li>Ordering
items from the catalog.</li>
<li>Viewing
the user's order history.</li>
<li>Configuration
of settings.</li>
</ul>
The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the
architecture of the sample application:
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZV1QjNcRsbI/WTVf4aeT3pI/AAAAAAAACzw/n4EGbKl4rNgIBYjO3UliNhS3ll0Qm-rnQCLcB/s1600/architecture.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="847" data-original-width="1600" height="338" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZV1QjNcRsbI/WTVf4aeT3pI/AAAAAAAACzw/n4EGbKl4rNgIBYjO3UliNhS3ll0Qm-rnQCLcB/s640/architecture.png" width="640" /></a></div>
The sample application ships with three client apps:
<br />
<ul>
<li>An
MVC application developed with ASP.NET Core.</li>
<li>A
Single Page Application (SPA) developed with Angular 2 and Typescript. This
approach for web applications avoids performing a round-trip to the server with
each operation.</li>
<li>A
mobile app developed with Xamarin.Forms, which supports iOS, Android, and the
Universal Windows Platform (UWP).</li>
</ul>
For information about the web applications, see <a href="http://aka.ms/WebAppEbook">Architecting and Developing Modern Web
Applications with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure</a>.<br />
<br />
<div class="Paragraph">
The sample application includes the following backend
services:</div>
<ul>
<li>An
identity microservice, which uses ASP.NET Core Identity and IdentityServer.</li>
<li>A
catalog microservice, which is a data-driven create, read, update, delete
(CRUD) service that consumes an SQL Server database using EntityFramework Core.</li>
<li>An
ordering microservice, which is a domain-driven service that uses domain-driven
design patterns.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0078d7; font-family: &quot;symbol&quot;; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</span></span>A
basket microservice, which is a data-driven CRUD service that uses Redis Cache.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-indent: 0cm;">These
backend services are implemented as microservices using ASP.NET Core MVC, and
are deployed as unique containers within a single Docker host. Collectively,
these backend services are referred to as the eShopOnContainers reference
application. Client apps communicate with the backend services through a
Representational State Transfer (REST) web interface.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: 0cm;">For
information about the implementation of the backend services, see </span><a href="https://aka.ms/microservicesebook" style="text-indent: 0cm;">.NET Microservices: Architecture for
Containerized .NET Applications</a><span style="text-indent: 0cm;">.</span><br />
<br />
<h3>
What's the mobile app?</h3>
<div class="Paragraph">
The guide focuses
on building cross-platform enterprise apps using Xamarin.Forms, and uses the
eShopOnContainers mobile app as an example. The following screenshots show the pages from the
eShopOnContainers mobile app that provide the functionality outlined earlier:</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QYqdVQpsdDA/WTVgZA-z8qI/AAAAAAAACz0/HbcUecoT_LEPvKH3DgkF3nnfPISTWV3RgCLcB/s1600/screenshots.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="747" data-original-width="855" height="556" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QYqdVQpsdDA/WTVgZA-z8qI/AAAAAAAACz0/HbcUecoT_LEPvKH3DgkF3nnfPISTWV3RgCLcB/s640/screenshots.png" width="640" /></a></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<br /></div>
<div class="Paragraph">
The mobile app consumes the backend services provided by the
eShopOnContainers reference application. However, it can be configured to
consume data from mock services for those who wish to avoid deploying the
backend services.</div>
<br />
<div class="Paragraph">
The eShopOnContainers mobile app exercises the following
Xamarin.Forms functionality:</div>
<ul>
<li>XAML</li>
<li>Controls</li>
<li>Bindings</li>
<li>Converters</li>
<li>Styles</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Commands</li>
<li>Behaviors</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Effects</li>
<li>Custom
Renderers</li>
<li>MessagingCenter</li>
<li>Custom
Controls</li>
</ul>
<div class="Paragraph">
In addition, unit tests are
provided for some of the classes in the eShopOnContainers mobile app. For more information about this functionality, see the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/">Xamarin.Forms
documentation</a> on the Xamarin Developer Center, and <a href="https://aka.ms/xamebook">Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms</a>.</div>
