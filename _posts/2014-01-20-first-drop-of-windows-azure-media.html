<p>The first drop of the Windows Azure Media Services guidance can be found on <a href="https://wamsg.codeplex.com/">codeplex</a>. To compile the code you’ll need Windows 8.1, Visual Studio 2013, and the Windows Azure SDK. Obviously the usual caveats apply to the download, as it’s not final released code yet.</p> <p>The project is about producing guidance for using Windows Azure Media Services in conjunction with a Content Management System (CMS) for providing an on-demand video service. The project will show how to link Windows Azure Media Services assets to a CMS entry as well as how to ingest, encode, publish, and consume videos on the following platforms:</p> <ul> <li>Windows 8.1</li> <li>Windows Phone 8</li> <li>HTML 5</li> <li>iOS 5</li> <li>Android Jelly Beans 4.1 (API Level 16)</li></ul>
