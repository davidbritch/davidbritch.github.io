<p>Hilo is a Windows Store app I helped <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/bb190332.aspx">patterns &amp; practices</a> to develop earlier in the year. The app, developed using C++ and XAML, is an end-to-end app that demonstrates modern development practices for building Windows Store apps. The app, along with the accompanying guidance documentation, demonstrates to Windows Store app developers how to:</p> <ul> <li>Implement common functionality for apps, such as tiles, pages, controls, navigation, file system integration, and suspend/resume.  <li>Implement the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Repository patterns.  <li>Use modern C++ effectively in apps.  <li>Implement asynchronous programming to make an app fast and fluid.  <li>Use Accelerated Massive Parallelism (AMP) to offload intensive computation to the GPU.  <li>Make an app ready for the global market.  <li>Test and app and tune its performance. </li></ul> <p>The app has now been released as a Windows 8 SDK sample, and can be downloaded <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Hilo-C-sample-b53fd433">here</a>. The documentation can be found on the Windows Dev Center <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj160316.aspx">here</a>.</p>
