<p>The third drop of Prism for the Windows Runtime, and the associated AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation, can be found on <a href="https://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/releases/view/115137">codeplex</a>. To compile the code you’ll need Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2013. Obviously the usual caveats apply to the download, as it’s not final released code yet.</p> <h3>Change Log</h3> <ul> <li>Numerous bug fixes.</li> <li>The Quickstarts have been retargeted to Windows 8.1 and any attached behaviours have been replaced with Blend behaviours.</li> <li>Prism’s <strong>SearchPaneService</strong> and <strong>SearchQueryArguments</strong> classes have been deprecated.</li> <li>Search activation support has been removed from the RI and the <strong>MvvmAppBase</strong> class.</li> <li>Search is provided in the RI with the <strong>SearchBox</strong> control.</li> <li>Search suggestions are provided from the web service on demand.</li> <li>The <strong>HighlightSearchBehavior</strong> has been converted to an <strong>IAction</strong> named <strong>HighlightSearchAction</strong>.</li> <li>Prism includes support for extended splash screens (see the ExtendedSplashScreenQuickstart sample).</li> <li><strong>AutoRotatingGridView</strong> controls are now retaining proportional scroll position across landscape/portrait orientation as well during the terminate/resume process.</li></ul>
