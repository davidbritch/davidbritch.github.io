<p>The <a href="http://www.davidbritch.com/2016/02/behaviours-library-for-xamarinforms_24.html">Behaviors Library for Xamarin.Forms</a> seems to have been well received, so I intend enhancing it as time allows. This includes:</p> <ul> <li>Ensuring that behaviors can be added to pages. At the moment they can only be added to views.</li> <li>Adding more useful behaviors. I have plenty of ideas here.</li></ul> <p>Questions? Problems? Thoughts? Suggestions? Then <a href="https://twitter.com/britchdavid">drop me a line</a>.</p>
