<p>It’s been a few months since I last blogged. That’s because I’ve been busy working on another project with the <a href="http://pnp.azurewebsites.net/en-us/">patterns &amp; practices</a> team at Microsoft. Now that the project is finished and near release, I’ll be able to find the time to start blogging again. So stay tuned for blog articles about how to accelerate the development of Windows Store apps.</p>
