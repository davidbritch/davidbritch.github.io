<p>Many of you will be familiar with Prism, a <a href="http://pnp.azurewebsites.net/en-us/">patterns &amp; practices</a> release that helps you to design and build composite applications. Since last year I've been working with <a href="http://pnp.azurewebsites.net/en-us/">patterns &amp; practices</a> on the next evolution of Prism known as Prism for the Windows Runtime. <p>Prism for the Windows Runtime provides two libraries that help developers create managed Windows Store apps:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.StoreApps/">Microsoft.Practices.Prism.StoreApps</a> library provides support for bootstrapping MVVM apps, state management, validation of user input, navigation, data binding, commands, Flyouts, settings, and search.  <li>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.PubSubEvents/">Microsoft.Practices.Prism.PubSubEvents</a> Portable Class Library allows communication between loosely coupled components in an app, thus helping to reduce dependencies between assemblies in a Visual Studio solution.</li></ul> <p>Together the libraries accelerate development of apps by providing support for MVVM, loosely coupled communication, and the core services required in Windows Store apps.</p> <p>As well as Prism for the Windows Runtime, another deliverable from the project is the AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation, which is a Windows Store business app that demonstrates how to create an app using Prism for the Windows Runtime to accelerate development. The reference implementation provides guidance on how to implement MVVM with navigation and lifecycle management, validation, manage application data, implement controls, accessible and localizable pages, touch, search, tiles, and tiles notifications. It can be downloaded <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Prism-for-the-Windows-86b8fb72">here</a>.</p> <p>The project also contains three Quickstart apps:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130660.aspx">Validation Quickstart for Windows Store apps using the MVVM pattern</a></li> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130644.aspx">Event aggregation Quickstart for Windows Store apps</a></li> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130638.aspx">Bootstrapping an MVVM app using Prism for the Windows Runtime</a></li></ul> <p>For more info see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130643.aspx">Developing a Windows Store business app using C#, XAML, and Prism for the Windows Runtime</a> on the Windows dev center.</p>
