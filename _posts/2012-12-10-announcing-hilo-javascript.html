<p>Hilo is a Windows Store app I helped <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/bb190332.aspx">patterns &amp; practices</a> to develop earlier in the year. The app, originally developed using C++ and XAML, is an end-to-end app that demonstrates modern development practices for building Windows Store apps. </p> <p>Weâ€™ve now finished redeveloping Hilo as a WinJS app. The app, along with the accompanying guidance documentation, demonstrates to Windows Store app developers how to:</p> <ul> <li>Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Windows Runtime to create a world-ready app for the global market.  <li>Implement tiles, pages, controls, touch, navigation, file system queries, and suspend/resume.  <li>Implement the Model-View-Presenter and query builder patterns.  <li>Test your app and tune its performance.</li></ul> <p>Hilo JavaScript can be found on the Windows Dev Center <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj674095.aspx">here</a>.</p>
