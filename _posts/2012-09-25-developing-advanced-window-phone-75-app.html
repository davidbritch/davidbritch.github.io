<p>Last year I worked with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/bb190332.aspx">Patterns and Practices</a> to develop a number of pieces of guidance concerning Windows Phone development. One such item has just been published as a book, and so I thought I’d summarize it here.</p> <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg490765">Developing an Advanced Windows Phone 7.5 App that Connects to the Cloud</a> will show you how to design and implement a compelling end-to-end application using the Windows Phone 7.1 SDK. Some of the topics that you will learn about include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Displaying user interface notifications  <li>Using the MVVM pattern  <li>Managing state and performing navigation  <li>Encrypting and decrypting credentials  <li>Persisting data to and from isolated storage  <li>Synchronizing data between a Windows Phone device and a cloud service, both in the background and the foreground  <li>Pinning Application Tiles and Secondary Tiles to Start  <li>Capturing location data, image data, and audio data  <li>Authenticating with a cloud service from a Windows Phone application  <li>Pushing notifications to Windows Phone devices  <li>Transferring data between a Windows Phone device and a cloud service  <li>Abstracting the Windows Phone 7.1 SDK  <li>Unit testing MVVM applications </li></ul> <p>This guide has an accompanying example application—the Surveys mobile client application for Windows Phone. You can download the application and run it on your own computer to see how it works and to experiment and reuse the code.</p>For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg490765">Developing an Advanced Windows Phone 7.5 App that Connects to the Cloud</a>.
