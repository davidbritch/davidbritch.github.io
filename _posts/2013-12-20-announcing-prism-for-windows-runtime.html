<p>Back in May the <a href="http://pnp.azurewebsites.net/en-us/">patterns &amp; practices</a> team at Microsoft released a new guide for Windows 8 on creating Windows Store business apps using C# and XAML. The guide came with source code Prism for the Windows Runtime, source code for the AdventureWorks Shopper product catalog and shopping cart reference implementation, and documentation. The documentation provided guidance on how to implement MVVM with navigation and app lifecycle management, validation, manage application data, implement controls, accessible and localizable pages, touch, search, tiles, and tile notifications. It also provided guidance on testing an app and tuning its performance.</p> <p>We’ve now updated the guide for Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2013 and it can be found on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130643.aspx">Windows Developer Center</a>.</p> <h3>What’s it all about?</h3> <p>Developers of Windows Store business apps face several challenges. App requirements can change over time. New business opportunities and challenges may present themselves. Ongoing customer feedback during development may significantly affect the requirements of the app. Therefore it's important to build an app that it is flexible and can be easily modified or extended over time.</p> <p>Prism for the Windows Runtime provides an architecture that helps to do just that. It is designed to help developers create apps that need to accomplish the following:</p> <ul> <li>Address the common Windows Store app development scenarios.</li> <li>Separate the concerns of presentation, presentation logic, and model through support for Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).</li> <li>Use an architectural infrastructure to produce a consistent and high quality app.</li></ul> <p>The architecture provided by Prism helps to produce flexible, maintainable, and testable apps. It includes components that help to accelerate development of your app by providing support for MVVM, loosely coupled communication, and the core services required in Windows Store apps, allowing you to focus on developing the user experiences for your app. For more info see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130655.aspx">Prism for the Windows Runtime reference</a>.</p> <h3>What do I get?</h3> <ul> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130643.aspx">Documentation</a>. The documentation provides guidance on how to implement MVVM with navigation and app lifecycle management, manage application data, implement controls, accessible and localizable pages, touch, validation, search, tiles, and tile notifications. It also provides guidance on testing your app and tuning its performance.</li> <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=275571">Portable Document Format (PDF)</a>. A PDF version of the on-line guidance, for printing or reading offline.</li> <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=275570">AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation source code</a>. A Visual Studio solution containing all the projects that make up the AdventureWorks Shopper product catalog and shopping cart reference implementation.</li> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130652.aspx">Quickstarts</a>. The guidance includes a number of Quickstarts that illustrate specific concepts. Many of the Quickstarts use Prism for the Windows Runtime.</li> <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=275570">Prism for the Windows Runtime source code</a>. Source code for the two libraries that help to accelerate the development of managed Windows Store apps.</li> <li>Prism for the Windows Runtime NuGet packages. NuGet packages for the two libraries that help to accelerate the development of managed Windows Store apps.</li></ul> <h3>Where should I start?</h3><br> <ul> <li>Review the AdventureWorks Reference implementation. After you download the code, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130645.aspx">Getting started using Prism for the Windows Runtime</a> for instructions on how to compile and run the reference implementation, as well as understand the Visual Studio solution structure.</li> <li>Review Quickstarts. The guidance provides five Quickstart samples that focus on specific tasks—<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130660.aspx">validation</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130644.aspx">event aggregation</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130638.aspx">bootstrapping an MVVM app</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn535963.aspx">extended splash screens</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn535964.aspx">incremental loading of items in GridView controls</a>.</li> <li>Create an app using the Prism for the Windows Runtime. If you want to create your own app using Prism see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130642.aspx">Using Prism for the Windows Runtime</a>.</li> <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn535962.aspx">Explore developer tasks</a>. Learn how the team implemented many of the tasks required to create a Windows Store app.</li> <li>Review the documentation. The associated documentation outlines the key decisions and lessons learned when creating a Windows Store business app.</li></ul> <h3>Where can I get help?</h3> <p>Prism for the Windows Runtime, like many patterns &amp; practices deliverables, has a community site. On the community site you can post questions, provide feedback, connect with other users to share ideas, and find additional content such as extensions and training material. Community members can also help Microsoft plan and test future releases of Prism for the Windows Runtime.
