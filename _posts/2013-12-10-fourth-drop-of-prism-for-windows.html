<p>The fourth drop of Prism for the Windows Runtime, and the associated AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation, can be found on <a href="https://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/releases/view/115908">codeplex.</a> To compile the code you’ll need Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2013. Obviously the usual caveats apply to the download, as it’s not final released code yet.</p> <p><strong>Change Log</strong></p> <ul> <li>Numerous bug fixes, including fixing UI issues related to high contrast.</li> <li>Updates to the <strong>SearchUserControl</strong>.</li> <li>Updates to the incremental loading quickstart.</li></ul>
