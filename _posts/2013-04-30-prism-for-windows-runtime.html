<p>As I’ve previously mentioned, I’ve been busy recently working on another project with the <a href="http://pnp.azurewebsites.net/en-us/">patterns &amp; practices</a> team at Microsoft. The project provides guidance to developers who want to create a Windows Store business app using C#, XAML, the Windows Runtime, and modern development practices. The deliverables from the project are:</p> <ul> <li>Prism for the Windows Runtime <li>The AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation <li>Quickstart apps <li>Guidance documentation</li></ul> <p>Prism for the Windows Runtime provides two libraries that help developers create managed Windows Store apps. The libraries accelerate development of Windows Store apps by providing support for MVVM, loosely coupled communication, and the core services required in Windows Store apps. The <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.StoreApps/">Microsoft.Practices.Prism.StoreApps</a> library provides support for bootstrapping MVVM apps, state management, validation of user input, navigation, data binding, commands, Flyouts, settings, and search. The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.PubSubEvents/">Microsoft.Practices.Prism.PubSubEvents</a> Portable Class Library allows communication between loosely coupled components in an app, thus helping to reduce dependencies between assemblies in a Visual Studio solution.</p> <p>The AdventureWorks Shopper reference implementation is a Windows Store business app that demonstrates how to create an app using Prism for the Windows Runtime to accelerate development.</p> <p>The project also features three Quickstart apps:</p> <ul> <li>Validation Quickstart for Windows Store apps using the MVVM pattern  <li>Event aggregation Quickstart for Windows Store apps  <li>Bootstrapping an MVVM app using Prism for the Windows Runtime</li></ul> <p>Stay tuned for an announcement for when the project goes live. In the meantime a near final version of it can be found <a href="http://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/">here</a>.</p>
