<p>Last year, I <a href="https://www.davidbritch.com/2019/10/xamarin-connecting-to-localhost-over.html">wrote about</a> how to connect to localhost over HTTPS from iOS simulators and Android emulators. Connecting to localhost web services that run over HTTP is straight forward, however itâ€™s more work when the web service runs over HTTPS. It typically involves:</p><ul><li>Creating a self-signed developer certificate on your machine.</li>
<li>Choosing the network stack to use.</li>
<li>Specifying the address of your local machine.</li>
<li>Bypassing the local development certificate check.</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/xamarin/cross-platform/deploy-test/connect-to-local-web-services">Connect to local web services from iOS simulators and Android emulators</a> documents how to carry out the above steps. However, I recently discovered that the approach for bypassing the local development certificate check on iOS no longer worked.</p><p>At the time of writing the <a href="https://www.davidbritch.com/2019/10/xamarin-connecting-to-localhost-over.html">original blog post</a>, the CoreFX implementation of <strong>HttpClient</strong> was in most Mono profiles, but not in iOS. The recommendation for iOS was to use the managed network stack, and the <strong>ServicePointManager</strong> API. However. since then iOS support for the CoreFX <strong>HttpClient</strong> implementation has dropped, which hooks into the <strong>NSUrlSession</strong> network stack. This ultimately means that now, on both iOS and Android, the approach for bypassing the local development certificate check is identical.</p><p>SSL errors can be ignored on iOS and Android for local HTTPS web services by setting the <strong>HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback</strong> property to a callback that ignores the result of the certificate security check for the localhost certificate:</p><pre><code class="cs">public HttpClientHandler GetInsecureHandler()
{
    HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler();
    handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) =>
    {
        if (cert.Issuer.Equals("CN=localhost"))
            return true;
        return errors == System.Net.Security.SslPolicyErrors.None;
    };
    return handler;
}</code></pre>This method must be in a class in a platform project, even if the <strong>HttpClient</strong> object is constructed in a shared project. The <strong>HttpClientHandler</strong> object returned by the <strong>GetInsecureHandler</strong> method should then be passed as an argument to the <strong>HttpClient</strong> constructor:</p><pre><code class="cs">HttpClient client = new HttpClient(GetInsecureHandler());</code></pre>The advantage of using this approach is that it hooks into the native network stacks on both iOS and Android (<strong>NSUrlSession</strong> on iOS, <strong>AndroidClientHandler</strong> on Android). </p><p>For a full sample that demonstrates this approach in Xamarin.Forms, see my <a href="https://github.com/davidbritch/xamarin-forms/tree/master/TodoREST">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
