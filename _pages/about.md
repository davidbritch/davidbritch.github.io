Welcome to Dave's tech lab - a blog written by a former academic and former Microsoftie. I originally launched this blog during the Windows Phone era, and hosted it on Blogger.

In 2022, I decided to step away from blogging and took the content offline. But now, the blog lives again! I've restored all of my original Blogger content, though you might notice some layout issues and broken links. Since that content is outdated, I don't plan to fix those issues.

Starting summer 2025, all new posts will be written in Markdown and properly formatted.
